# TechBot
A Bot that will help with basic operational technical questions of Windows. 

This bot is from [this](https://github.com/liouh/chat-bot) respo. 


Some important things:

- Bot isn't a replacement for official support from Microsoft, or any other help site articles. 

- Bot relies on a Small Scale set of keywords. So its going to be hard. - Maybe I will adapt another system? 

- The bot isn't always going to be accurate. It is a bot!

- The bot will cite a brief few things along with a Verified source of information. 

- The bot is not smart. (yet?)

- The bot is currently a work in progress
